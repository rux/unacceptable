# Cornflake

The purpose is to create a Mexican Wave via the medium of mobile phones

It is sonar- and ad-hoc-network-based.

This is a project by [Russ Anderson](http://github.com/rux/) and [Tom York](http://github.com/tyork/) of [Yell Labs](http://www.yell.com/mobilephones/yell-labs.html).  It was started for the February 2011 Hack Day.  It won a "special mention" but failed to take the top prize.  Considering it wasn't working for the presentation, this does seem fair of the judges.
